special picture        \\namong tar-banded ancient cherry trees,        \\nset well back from the road in rank lodged grass,        \\nthe little cottage we were speaking of,                5\\na front with just a door between two windows,        \\nfresh painted by the shower a velvet black.        \\nwe paused, the minister and i, to look.        \\nhe made as if to hold it at arm’s length        \\nor put the leaves aside that framed it in.               \\n“pretty,” he said. “come in. no one will care.”        \\nthe path was a vague parting in the grass        \\nthat led us to a weathered window-sill.        \\nwe pressed our faces to the pane. “you see,” he said,        \\n“everything’s as she left it when she died.                \\nher sons won’t sell the house or the things in it.        \\nthey say they mean to come and summer here        \\nwhere they were boys. they haven’t come this year.        \\nthey live so far away—one is out west—        \\nit will be hard for them to keep their word.                \\nanyway they won’t have the place disturbed.”        \\na buttoned hair-cloth lounge spread scrolling arms        \\nunder a crayon portrait on the wall        \\ndone sadly from an old daguerreotype.        \\n“that was the father as he went to war.                \\nshe always, when she talked about war,        \\nsooner or later came and leaned, half knelt        \\nagainst the lounge beside it, though i doubt        \\nif such unlifelike lines kept power to stir        \\nanything in her after all the years.                \\nhe fell at gettysburg or fredericksburg,        \\ni ought to know—it makes a difference which:        \\nfredericksburg wasn’t gettysburg, of course.        \\nbut what i’m getting to is how forsaken        \\na little cottage this has always seemed;                \\nsince she went more than ever, but before—        \\ni don’t mean altogether by the lives        \\nthat had gone out of it, the father first,        \\nthen the two sons, till she was left alone.        \\n(nothing could draw her after those two sons.                \\nshe valued the considerate neglect        \\nshe had at some cost taught them after years.)        \\ni mean by the world’s having passed it by—        \\nas we almost got by this afternoon.        \\nit always seems to me a sort of mark                \\nto measure how far fifty years have brought us.        \\nwhy not sit down if you are in no haste?        \\nthese doorsteps seldom have a visitor.        \\nthe warping boards pull out their own old nails        \\nwith none to tread and put them in their place.                \\nshe had her own idea of things, the old lady.        \\nand she liked talk. she had seen garrison        \\nand whittier, and had her story of them.        \\none wasn’t long in learning that she thought        \\nwhatever else the civil war was for                \\nit wasn’t just to keep the states together,        \\nnor just to free the slaves, though it did both.        \\nshe wouldn’t have believed those ends enough        \\nto have given outright for them all she gave.        \\nher giving somehow touched the principle                \\nthat all men are created free and equal.        \\nand to hear her quaint phrases—so removed        \\nfrom the world’s view to-day of all those things.        \\nthat’s a hard mystery of jefferson’s.        \\nwhat did he mean? of course the easy way                \\nis to decide it simply isn’t true.        \\nit may not be. i heard a fellow say so.        \\nbut never mind, the welshman got it planted        \\nwhere it will trouble us a thousand years.        \\neach age will have to reconsider it.                \\nyou couldn’t tell her what the west was saying,        \\nand what the south to her serene belief.        \\nshe had some art of hearing and yet not        \\nhearing the latter wisdom of the world.        \\nwhite was the only race she ever knew.                \\nblack she had scarcely seen, and yellow never.        \\nbut how could they be made so very unlike        \\nby the same hand working in the same stuff?        \\nshe had supposed the war decided that.        \\nwhat are you going to do with such a person?                \\nstrange how such innocence gets its own way.        \\ni shouldn’t be surprised if in this world        \\nit were the force that would at last prevail.        \\ndo you know but for her there was a time        \\nwhen to please younger members of the church,                \\nor rather say non-members in the church,        \\nwhom we all have to think of nowadays,        \\ni would have changed the creed a very little?        \\nnot that she ever had to ask me not to;        \\nit never got so far as that; but the bare thought                \\nof her old tremulous bonnet in the pew,        \\nand of her half asleep was too much for me.        \\nwhy, i might wake her up and startle her.        \\nit was the words ‘descended into hades’        \\nthat seemed too pagan to our liberal youth.                \\nyou know they suffered from a general onslaught.        \\nand well, if they weren’t true why keep right on        \\nsaying them like the heathen? we could drop them.        \\nonly—there was the bonnet in the pew.        \\nsuch a phrase couldn’t have meant much to her.                \\nbut suppose she had missed it from the creed        \\nas a child misses the unsaid good-night,        \\nand falls asleep with heartache—how should i feel?        \\ni’m just as glad she made me keep hands off,        \\nfor, dear me, why abandon a belief                \\nmerely because it ceases to be true.        \\ncling to it long enough, and not a doubt        \\nit will turn true again, for so it goes.        \\nmost of the change we think we see in life        \\nis due to truths being in and out of favour.               \\nas i sit here, and oftentimes, i wish        \\ni could be monarch of a desert land        \\ni could devote and dedicate forever        \\nto the truths we keep coming back and back to.        \\nso desert it would have to be, so walled                \\nby mountain ranges half in summer snow,        \\nno one would covet it or think it worth        \\nthe pains of conquering to force change on.        \\nscattered oases where men dwelt, but mostly        \\nsand dunes held loosely in tamarisk                \\nblown over and over themselves in idleness.        \\nsand grains should sugar in the natal dew        \\nthe babe born to the desert, the sand storm        \\nretard mid-waste my cowering caravans—        \\n“there are bees in this wall.” he struck the clapboards,                \\nfierce heads looked out; small

end and blossom end, \\nand every fleck of russet showing clear. \\nmy instep arch not only keeps the ache, \\nit keeps the pressure of a ladder-round. \\nand i keep hearing from the cellar-bin \\nthat rumbling sound \\nof load on load of apples coming in. \\nfor i have had too much \\nof apple-picking; i am overtired \\nof the great harvest i myself desired. \\nthere were ten thousand thousand fruit to touch, \\ncherish in hand, lift down, and not let fall, \\nfor all \\nthat struck the earth, \\nno matter if not bruised, or spiked with stubble, \\nwent surely to the cider-apple heap \\nas of no worth. \\none can see what will trouble \\nthis sleep of mine, whatever sleep it is. \\nwere he not gone, \\nthe woodchuck could say whether it’s like his \\nlong sleep, as i describe its coming on, \\nor just some human sleep. <eos>', '<sos> there were three in the meadow by the brook, \\ngathering up windrows, piling haycocks up, \\nwith an eye always lifted toward the west, \\nwhere an irregular, sun-bordered cloud \\ndarkly advanced with a perpetual dagger \\nflickering across its bosom. suddenly \\none helper, thrusting pitchfork in the ground, \\nmarched himself off the field and home. one stayed. \\nthe town-bred farmer failed to understand.\\nwhat was there wrong? \\nsomething you said just now. \\nwhat did i say? \\nabout our taking pains. \\nto cock the hay?—because it’s going to shower? \\ni said that nearly half an hour ago. \\ni said it to myself as much as you.\\nyou didn’t know. but james is one big fool. \\nhe thought you meant to find fault with his work. \\nthat’s what the average farmer would have meant. \\njames had to take his time to chew it over \\nbefore he acted; he’s just got round to act.\\nhe is a fool if that’s the way he takes me.\\ndon’t let it bother you. you’ve found out something. \\nthe hand that knows his business won’t be told \\nto do work faster or better—those two things. \\ni’m as particular as anyone: \\nmost likely i’d have served you just the same: \\nbut i know you don’t understand our ways. \\nyou were just talking what was in your mind, \\nwhat was in all our minds, and you weren’t hinting. \\ntell you a story of what happened once. \\ni was up here in salem, at a man’s \\nnamed sanders, with a gang of four or five, \\ndoing the haying. no one liked the boss. \\nhe was one of the kind sports call a spider, \\nall wiry arms and legs that spread out wavy \\nfrom a humped body nigh as big as a biscuit. \\nbut work!—that man could work, especially \\nif by so doing he could get more work \\nout of his hired help. i’m not denying \\nhe was hard on himself: i couldn’t find \\nthat he kept any hours—not for himself. \\nday-light and lantern-light were one to him: \\ni’ve heard him pounding in the barn all night. \\nbut what he liked was someone to encourage. \\nthem that he couldn’t lead he’d get behind \\nand drive, the way you can, you know, in mowing \\nkeep at their heels and threaten to mow their legs off. \\ni’d seen about enough of his bulling tricks— \\nwe call that bulling. i’d been watching him. \\nso when he paired off with me in the hayfield \\nto load the load, thinks i, look out for trouble! \\ni built the load and topped it off; old sanders \\ncombed it down with the rake and said, ‘o. k.’ \\neverything went right till we reached the barn \\nwith a big take to empty in a bay. \\nyou understand that meant the easy job \\nfor the man up on top of throwing down \\nthe hay and rolling it off wholesale, \\nwhere, on a mow, it would have been slow lifting. \\nyou wouldn’t think a fellow ‘d need much urging \\nunder those circumstances, would you now? \\nbut the old fool seizes his fork in both hands, \\nand looking up bewhiskered out of the pit, \\nshouts like an army captain, ‘let her come!’ \\nthinks i, d’ye mean it? ‘what was that you said?’ \\ni asked out loud so’s there’d be no mistake. \\n‘did you say, let her come?’ ‘yes, let her come.’ \\nhe said it over, but he said it softer. \\nnever you say a thing like that to a man, \\nnot if he values what he is. god, i’d as soon \\nmurdered him as left out his middle name. \\ni’d built the load and knew just where to find it. \\ntwo or three forkfuls i picked lightly round for \\nlike meditating, and then i just dug in \\nand dumped the rackful on him in ten lots. \\ni looked over the side once in the dust \\nand caught sight of him treading-water-like, \\nkeeping his head above. ‘damn ye,’ i says, \\n‘that gets ye!’ he squeaked like a squeezed rat.\\nthat was the last i saw or heard of him. \\ni cleaned the rack and drove out to cool off. \\nas i sat mopping the hayseed from my neck, \\nand sort of waiting to be asked about it, \\none of the boys sings out, ‘where’s the old man?’ \\n‘i left him in the barn,—under the hay. \\nif you want him you can go and dig him out.’ \\nthey realized from the way i swobbed my neck \\nmore than was needed, something must be up. \\nthey headed for the barn i stayed where i was. \\nthey told me afterward: first they forked hay, \\na lot of it, out into the barn floor. \\nnothing! they listened for him. not a rustle!\\ni guess they thought i’d spiked him in the temple \\nbefore i buried him, else i couldn’t have managed. \\nthey excavated more. ‘go keep his wife \\nout of the barn.’\\nsome one looked in a window; \\nand curse me, if he wasn’t in the kitchen, \\nslumped way down in a chair, with both his feet \\nstuck in the oven, the hottest day that summer. \\nhe looked so mad in back, and so disgusted \\nthere was no one that dared to stir him up \\nor let him know that he was being looked at. \\napparently i hadn’t buried him \\n(i may have knocked him down), but just my trying \\nto bury him had hurt his dignity. \\nhe had gone to the house so’s not to face me. \\nhe kept away from us all afternoon. \\nwe tended to his hay. we saw him out \\nafter a while picking peas in the garden: \\nhe couldn’t keep away from doing something.\\nweren’t you relieved to find he wasn’t dead?\\nno!—and yet i can’t say: it’s hard to tell. \\ni went about to kill him fair enough.\\nyou took an awkward way. did he discharge you?\\ndischarge me? no! he knew i did just right.\\n\\n\\n <eos>', '<sos> a governor it was proclaimed this time,\\nwhen all who would come seeking in new hampshire\\nancestral memories

verge\\nthat turned them on the world, and try to fathom\\nthe past and get some strangeness out of it.\\nbut rain spoiled all. the day began uncertain,\\nwith clouds low trailing and moments of rain that misted.\\nthe young folk held some hope out to each other\\ntill well toward noon when the storm settled down\\nwith a swish in the grass. “what if the others\\nare there,” they said. “it isn’t going to rain.”\\nonly one from a farm not far away\\nstrolled thither, not expecting he would find\\nanyone else, but out of idleness.\\none, and one other, yes, for there were two.\\nthe second round the curving hillside road\\nwas a girl; and she halted some way off\\nto reconnoitre, and then made up her mind\\nat least to pass by and see who he was,\\nand perhaps hear some word about the

down.”\\nprovision there had been for just such meeting\\nof stranger cousins, in a family tree\\ndrawn on a sort of passport with the branch\\nof the one bearing it done in detail—\\nsome zealous one’s laborious device.\\nshe made a sudden movement toward her bodice,\\nas one who clasps her heart. they laughed together.\\n“stark?” he inquired. “no matter for the proof.”\\n“yes, stark. and you?”\\n“i’m stark.” he drew his passport.\\n“you know we might not be and still be cousins:\\nthe town is full of chases, lowes, and baileys,\\nall claiming some priority in starkness.\\nmy mother was a lane, yet might have married\\nanyone upon earth and still her children\\nwould have been starks, and doubtless here to-day.”\\n“you riddle with your genealogy\\nlike a viola. i don’t follow you.”\\n“i only mean my mother was a stark\\nseveral times over, and by marrying father\\nno more than brought us back into the name.”\\n“one ought not to be thrown into confusion\\nby a plain statement of relationship,\\nbut i own what you say makes my head spin.\\nyou take my card—you seem so good at such things—\\nand see if you can reckon our cousinship.\\nwhy not take seats here on the cellar wall\\nand dangle feet among the raspberry vines?”\\n“under the shelter of the family tree.”\\n“just so—that ought to be enough protection.”\\n“not from the rain. i think it’s going to rain.”\\n“it’s raining.”\\n“no, it’s misting; let’s be fair.\\ndoes the rain seem to you to cool the eyes?”\\nthe situation was like this: the road\\nbowed outward on the mountain half-way up,\\nand disappeared and ended not far off.\\nno one went home that way. the only house\\nbeyond where they were was a shattered seedpod.\\nand below roared a brook hidden in trees,\\nthe sound of which was silence for the place.\\nthis he sat listening to till she gave judgment.\\n“on father’s side, it seems, we’re—let me see——”\\n“don’t be too technical.—you have three cards.”\\n“four cards, one yours,

this cellar hole\\nlike wild geese on a lake before a storm?\\nwhat do we see in such a hole, i wonder.”\\n“the indians had a myth of chicamoztoc,\\nwhich means the seven caves that we came out of.\\nthis is the pit from which we starks were digged.”\\n“you must be learned. that’s what you see in it?”\\n“and what do you see?”\\n“yes, what do i see?\\nfirst let me look. i see raspberry vines—”\\n“oh, if you’re going to use your eyes, just hear\\nwhat i see. it’s a little, little boy,\\nas pale and dim as a match flame in the sun;\\nhe’s groping in the cellar after jam,\\nhe thinks it’s dark and it’s flooded with daylight.”\\n“he’s nothing. listen. when i lean like this\\ni can make out old grandsir stark distinctly,—\\nwith his pipe in his mouth and his brown jug—\\nbless you, it isn’t grandsir stark, it’s granny,\\nbut the pipe’s there and smoking and the jug.\\nshe’s after cider, the old girl, she’s thirsty;\\nhere’s hoping she gets her drink and gets out safely.”\\n“tell

screen:\\nthe meaning of it all is out of you;\\nthe voices give you what you wish to hear.”\\n“strangely, it’s anything they wish to give.”\\n“then i don’t know. it must be strange enough.\\ni wonder if it’s not your make-believe.\\nwhat do you think you’re like to hear to-day?”\\n“from the sense of our having been together—\\nbut why take time for what i’m like to hear?\\ni’ll tell you what the voices really say.\\nyou will do very well right where you are\\na little longer. i mustn’t feel too hurried,\\nor i can’t give myself to hear the voices.”\\n“is this some trance you are withdrawing into?”\\n“you must be very still; you mustn’t talk.”\\n“i’ll hardly breathe.”\\n“the voices seem to say——”\\n“i’m waiting.”\\n“don’t! the voices seem to say:\\ncall her nausicaa, the unafraid\\nof an

had your name,\\nthough what a name should matter between us——”\\n“i shall suspect——”\\n“be good. the voices say:\\ncall her nausicaa, and take a timber\\nthat you shall find lies in the cellar

summer dwelling here,\\nand perhaps she will come, still unafraid,\\nand sit before you in the open door\\nwith flowers in her lap until they fade,\\nbut not come in across the sacred sill——”\\n“i wonder where your oracle is tending.\\nyou can see that there’s something wrong with it,\\nor it would speak in dialect. whose voice\\ndoes it purport to speak in? not old grandsir’s\\nnor granny’s, surely. call up one of them.\\nthey have best right to be heard in this place.”\\n“you seem so partial to our great-grandmother\\n(nine times removed. correct me if i err.)\\nyou will be likely to regard as sacred\\nanything she may say. but let me warn you,\\nfolks in her day were given to plain speaking.\\nyou think you’d best tempt her at such a time?”\\n“it rests with us always to cut her off.”\\n“well then, it’s granny speaking: ‘i dunnow!\\nmebbe i’m wrong to take it as i do.\\nthere ain’t no names quite like the old ones though,\\nnor never will be to my way of thinking.\\none mustn’t bear too hard on the new comers,\\nbut there’s a dite too many of them for comfort.\\ni should feel easier if i could see\\nmore of the salt wherewith they’re to be salted.\\nson, you do as

sometimes make too much\\nof the old stock? what counts is the ideals,\\nand those will bear some keeping still about.”\\n“i can see we are going to be good friends.”\\n“i like your ‘going to be.’ you said just now\\nit’s going to rain.”\\n“i know, and it was raining.\\ni let you say all that. but i must go now.”\\n“you let me say it? on consideration?\\nhow shall we say good-bye in such a case?”\\n“how shall we?”\\n“will you leave the way to me?”\\n“no, i don’t trust your eyes. you’ve said enough.\\nnow give me your hand up.—pick me that flower.”\\n“where shall we meet again?”\\n“nowhere but here\\nonce more before we meet elsewhere.”\\n“in rain?”\\n“it ought to be in rain. sometime in rain.\\nin rain to-morrow, shall we, if it rains?\\nbut if we must, in sunshine.” so she went. <eos>', '<sos> i let myself in at the kitchen door.\\n‘it’s you,’ she said. ‘i can’t get up. forgive me \\nnot answering your knock. i can no more \\nlet people in than i can keep them out. \\ni’m getting too old for my size, i tell them. \\nmy fingers are about all i’ve the use of \\nso’s to take any comfort. i can sew: \\ni help out with this beadwork what i can.’ \\n‘that’s a

shoes i primped to dance in!’ \\n‘and where’s john?’ \\n‘haven’t you seen him? strange what set you off \\nto come to his house when he’s gone to yours. \\nyou can’t have passed each other. i know what: \\nhe must have changed his mind and gone to garlands. \\nhe won’t be long in that case. you can wait. \\nthough what good you can be, or anyone- \\nit’s gone so far. you’ve heard? estelle’s run off.’ \\n‘yes, what’s it all about? when did she go?’ \\n‘two weeks since.’ \\n‘she’s in earnest, it appears.’ \\n‘i’m sure she won’t come back. she’s hiding somewhere. \\ni don’t know where myself. john thinks i do. \\nhe thinks i only have to say the word, \\nand she’ll come back. but, bless you, i’m her mother- \\ni can’t talk to her, and, lord, if i could!’ \\n‘it will go hard with john. what will he do? \\nhe can’t find anyone to take her place.’ \\n‘oh, if you ask me that, what will he do? \\nhe gets some sort of bakeshop meals together, \\nwith me to sit and tell him everything, \\nwhat’s wanted and how much and where it is. \\nbut when i’m gone- of course i can’t stay here: \\nestelle’s to take me when she’s settled down. \\nhe and i only hinder one another. \\ni tell them they can’t get me through the door, though: \\ni’ve been built in here like a big church organ. \\nwe’ve been here fifteen years.’ \\n‘that’s a long time \\nto live together and then pull apart. \\nhow do you see him living when you’re gone? \\ntwo of you out will leave an empty house.’ \\n‘i don’t just see him living many years, \\nleft here with nothing but the furniture. \\ni hate to think of the old place when we’re gone, \\nwith the brook going by below the yard, \\nand no one here but hens blowing about. \\nif he could sell the place, but then, he can’t: \\nno one will ever live on it again. \\nit’s too run down. this is the last of it. \\nwhat i think he will do, is let things smash. \\nhe’ll sort of swear the time away. he’s awful! \\ni never saw a man let family troubles \\nmake so much difference in his man’s affairs. \\nhe’s just dropped everything. he’s like a child. \\ni blame his being brought up by his mother. \\nhe’s got hay down that’s been rained on three times. \\nhe hoed a little yesterday for me: \\ni thought the growing things would do him good. \\nsomething went wrong. i saw him throw the hoe \\nsky-high with both hands. i can see it now- \\ncome here- i’ll show you- in that apple tree. \\nthat’s no way for a man to do at his age: \\nhe’s fifty-five, you know, if he’s a day.’ \\n‘aren’t you afraid of him? what’s that gun for?’ \\n‘oh, that’s been there for hawks since chicken-time. \\njohn hall touch me! not if he knows his friends. \\ni’ll say that for him, john’s no threatener \\nlike some men folk. no one’s afraid of him; \\nall is, he’s made up his mind not to stand \\nwhat he has got to stand.’ \\n‘where is estelle? \\ncouldn’t one talk to her? what does she say? \\nyou say you don’t know where she is.’ \\n‘nor want to! \\nshe thinks if it was bad to live with him, \\nit must be right to leave him.’ \\n‘which is wrong!’ \\n‘yes, but he should have married her.’ \\n‘i know.’ \\n‘the strain’s been too much for her all these years: \\ni can’t explain it any other way. \\nit’s different with a man, at least with john: \\nhe knows he’s kinder than the run of men. \\nbetter than married ought to be as good \\nas married- that’s what he has always said. \\ni know the way he’s felt- but all the same!’ \\n‘i wonder why he doesn’t marry her \\nand end it.’ \\n‘too late now: she wouldn’t have him. \\nhe’s given her time to think of something else. \\nthat’s his mistake. the dear knows my interest \\nhas been to keep the thing from breaking up. \\nthis is a good home: i don’t ask for better. \\nbut when i’ve said, ‘why shouldn’t they be married,’ \\nhe’d say, ‘why should they?’ no more words than that.’ \\n‘and after all why should they? john’s been fair \\ni take it. what was his was always hers. \\nthere was no quarrel about property.’ \\n‘reason enough, there was no property. \\na friend or two as good as own the farm, \\nsuch as it is. it isn’t worth the mortgage.’ \\n‘i mean estelle has always held the purse.’ \\n‘the rights of that are harder to get at. \\ni guess estelle and i have filled the purse. \\n‘twas we let him have money, not he us. \\njohn’s a bad farmer. i’m not blaming him. \\ntake it year in, year out, he doesn’t make much. \\nwe came here for a home for me, you know, \\nestelle to do the housework for the board \\nof both of us. but look how it turns out: \\nshe seems to have the housework, and besides, \\nhalf of the outdoor work, though as for that, \\nhe’d say she does it more because she likes it. \\nyou see our pretty things are all outdoors. \\nour hens and cows and pigs are always better \\nthan folks like us have any business with. \\nfarmers around twice as well off as we \\nhaven’t as good. they don’t go with the farm. \\none thing you can’t help liking about john, \\nhe’s fond of nice things- too fond, some would say. \\nbut estelle don’t complain: she’s like him there. \\nshe wants our hens to be the best there are. \\nyou never saw this room before a show, \\nfull of lank, shivery, half-drowned birds \\nin separate coops, having their plumage done. \\nthe smell of the wet feathers in the heat! \\nyou spoke of john’s not being safe to stay with. \\nyou don’t know what a gentle lot we are: \\nwe wouldn’t hurt a hen! you ought to see us \\nmoving a flock of hens from place to place. \\nwe’re not allowed to take them upside down, \\nall we can hold together by the legs. \\ntwo at a time’s the rule, one on each arm, \\nno matter how far and how many times \\nwe have to go.’ \\n‘you mean that’s john’s idea.’ \\n‘and we live up to it; or i don’t know \\nwhat childishness he wouldn’t give way to. \\nhe manages to keep the upper hand \\non his own farm. he’s boss. but as to hens: \\nwe fence our flowers in and the hens range. \\nnothing’s too good for them. we say it pays. \\njohn likes to tell the offers he has had, \\ntwenty for this cock, twenty-five for that. \\nhe never takes the money. if they’re worth \\nthat much to sell, they’re worth as much to keep. \\nbless you, it’s all expense, though. reach me down \\nthe little tin box on the cupboard shelf, \\nthe upper shelf, the tin box. that’s the one. \\ni’ll show you. here you are.’ \\n‘what’s this?’ \\n‘a bill- \\nfor fifty dollars for one langshang cock- \\nreceipted. and the cock is in the yard.’ \\n‘not in a glass case, then?’ \\n‘he’d need a tall one: \\nhe can eat off a barrel from the ground. \\nhe’s been in a glass case, as you may say, \\nthe crystal palace, london. he’s imported. \\njohn bought him, and we paid the bill with beads- \\nwampum, i call it. mind, we don’t complain. \\nbut you see, don’t you, we take care of him.’ \\n‘and like it, too. it makes it all the worse.’ \\n‘it seems as if. and that’s not all: he’s helpless \\nin ways that i can hardly tell you of. \\nsometimes he gets possessed to keep accounts \\nto see where all the money goes so fast. \\nyou know how men will be ridiculous. \\nbut it’s just fun the way he gets bedeviled- \\nif he’s untidy now, what will he be- – ? \\n‘it makes it all the worse. you must be blind.’ \\n‘estelle’s the one. you needn’t talk to me.’ \\n‘can’t you and i get to the root of it? \\nwhat’s the real trouble? what will satisfy her?’ \\n‘it’s as i say: she’s turned from him, that’s all.’ \\n‘but why, when she’s well off? is it the neighbours, \\nbeing cut off from friends?’ \\n‘we have our friends. \\nthat isn’t it. folks aren’t afraid of us.’ \\n‘she’s let it worry her. you stood the strain, \\nand you’re her mother.’ \\n‘but i didn’t always. \\ni didn’t relish it along at first. \\nbut i got wonted to it. and besides- \\njohn said i was too old to have grandchildren. \\nbut what’s the use of talking when it’s done? \\nshe won’t come back- it’s worse than that- she can’t.’ \\n‘why do you speak like that? what do you know? \\nwhat do you mean?- she’s done harm to herself?’ \\n‘i mean she’s married- married someone else.’ \\n‘oho, oho!’ \\n‘you don’t believe me.’ \\n‘yes, i do, \\nonly too well. i knew there must be something! \\nso that was what was back. she’s bad, that’s all!’ \\n‘bad to get married when she had the chance?’ \\n‘nonsense! see what’s she done! but who, who- – ‘ \\n‘who’d marry her straight out of such a mess? \\nsay it right out- no matter for her mother. \\nthe man was found. i’d better name no names. \\njohn himself won’t imagine who he is.’ \\n‘then it’s all up. i think i’ll get away. \\nyou’ll be expecting john. i pity estelle; \\ni suppose she deserves some pity, too. \\nyou ought to have the kitchen to yourself \\nto break it to him. you may have the job.’ \\n‘you needn’t think you’re going to get away. \\njohn’s almost here. i’ve had my eye on someone \\ncoming down ryan’s hill. i thought ’twas him. \\nhere he is now. this box! put it away. \\nand this bill.’ \\n‘what’s the hurry? he’ll unhitch.’ \\n‘no, he won’t, either. he’ll just drop the reins \\nand turn doll out to pasture, rig and all. \\nshe won’t get far before the wheels hang up \\non something- there’s no harm. see, there he is! \\nmy, but he looks as if he must have heard!’ \\njohn threw the door wide but he didn’t enter.\\n‘how are you, neighbour? just the man i’m after. \\nisn’t it hell,’ he said. ‘i want to know. \\ncome out here if you want to hear me talk. \\ni’ll talk to you, old woman, afterward. \\ni’ve got some news that maybe isn’t news. \\nwhat are they trying to do to me, these two?’ \\n‘do go along with him and stop his shouting.’ \\nshe raised her voice against the closing door:\\n‘who wants to hear your news, you- dreadful

such a time as this. he snapped it now.\\n“well, anne, go, dearie. our affair will wait.\\nthe lawyer man is thinking of his train.\\nhe wants to give me lots and lots of money\\nbefore he goes,

up bodily, chair and all, \\nand set herself back where she, started from. \\n‘she ain’t spick too much henglish- dat’s too bad.’ \\ni was afraid, in brightening first on me, \\nthen on baptiste, as if she understood \\n‘what passed between us, she was only reigning. \\nbaptiste was anxious for her; but no more \\nthan for himself, so placed he couldn’t hope \\nto keep his bargain of the morning with me \\nin time to keep me from suspecting him \\nof really never having meant to keep it.\\nneedlessly soon he had his axe-helves out, \\na quiverful to choose from, since he wished me \\nto have the best he had, or had to spare – \\nnot for me to ask which, when what he took \\nhad beauties he had to point me out at length \\nto ensure their not being wasted on me. \\nhe liked to have it slender as a whipstock, \\nfree from the least knot, equal to the strain \\nof bending like a sword across the knee. \\nhe showed me that the lines of a good helve \\nwere native to the grain before the knife \\nexpressed them, and its curves were no false curves \\nput on it from without. and there its strength lay \\nfor the hard work. he chafed its long white body \\nfrom end to end with his rough hand shut round it. \\nhe tried it at the eye-hold in the axe-head. \\n‘hahn, hahn,’ he mused, ‘don’t need much taking down.’ \\nbaptiste knew how to make a short job long \\nfor love of it, and yet not waste time either.\\ndo you know, what we talked about was knowledge? \\nbaptiste on his defence about the children \\nhe kept from school, or did his best to keep – \\nwhatever school and children and our doubts \\nof laid-on education had to do \\nwith the curves of his axe-helves and his having \\nused these unscrupulously to bring me \\nto see for once the inside of his house. \\nwas i desired in friendship, partly as some one \\nto leave it to, whether the right to hold \\nsuch doubts of education should depend \\nupon the education of those who held them. \\nbut now he brushed the shavings from his knee \\nand stood the axe there on its horse’s hoof, \\nerect, but not without its waves, as when \\nthe snake stood up for evil in the garden’- \\ntop-heavy with a
